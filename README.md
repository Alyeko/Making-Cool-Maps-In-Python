# Making-Cool-Maps-In-Python
## About
This is the official github repository, for the articles, [Making Cool Maps with Geopy and Folium](https://towardsdatascience.com/making-simple-maps-with-folium-and-geopy-4b9e8ab98c00) and [Your Cool Folium Maps on the Web](https://towardsdatascience.com/your-cool-folium-maps-on-the-web-313f9d1a6bcd) published in [TOWARDS DATA SCIENCE](https://towardsdatascience.com/), created to share how to create an interactive map, visualizing African cities with Geopy and Folium, and how to finally deploy it to the web. 

## Interactive map
[The interactive map](https://interactive-folium-map.herokuapp.com) was created with the folium package in python with the help of geopy.
Interactive maps are a way to present data at particular geographic locations in an aesthetically pleasing way. 

## Deploying to the web
The map was deployed to the web with heroku. [Here](https://towardsdatascience.com/your-cool-folium-maps-on-the-web-313f9d1a6bcd), you can see the steps taken to get this done.
